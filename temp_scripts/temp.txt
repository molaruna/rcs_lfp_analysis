FOOOF WARNING: Lower-bound peak width limit is < or ~= the frequency resolution: 1.00 <= 0.50
	Lower bounds below frequency-resolution have no effect (effective lower bound is the frequency resolution).
	Too low a limit may lead to overfitting noise as small bandwidth peaks.
	We recommend a lower bound of approximately 2x the frequency resolution.
